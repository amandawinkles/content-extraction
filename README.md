# content-extraction
Automated contract analysis and content extraction using watsonx, LangChain, Node.js, and React.js. 

CONTRACT PROCESSING EXAMPLE<p> 

## Summary
The accompanying tutorial video aims to guide users in developing a solution which automates the interpretation and processing of content such as contracts. The solution utilizes generative AI with capabilities for content extraction, summarization, and structured output. 

## Usage
Follow along with the tutorial to learn how to develop your own content extraction solution or fork and clone this repo, then install the dependencies using npm or yarn. Create a watsonx account at https://www.ibm.com/watsonx and put your credentials in a .env file in your cloned repo. Add this .env file, along with any others you want to keep private to a .gitignore file. Go to the Prompt Lab in watsonx to find the LLM credentials and parameters if you want to use different ones than those shown in this repo and tutorial. To run the program in this repo, use the command "node app.js" in your IDE terminal. To format your output in the .md file, use the Markdown Table Prettifier extension in VSCode or another of your choice. You could also choose to output to another type of file, depending on your use case.
